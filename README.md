# CSS Layout Challenge / Code Along

#### learn flexbox by trying to match a design

This workshop is designed to either just be a challenge or a code along that solves that challenge.

## The Challenge

Make the stuff in `index.html` look like the designs below, by changing the `index.css` file, and only using flexbox.
You should not be setting the height of the `content` elements.
You can change the html **only** to add wrapping div's or class names :smile:

You should design for mobile first (the media query is set to change for bigger screens. 
When the screen is mobile sized the title text will be black - it will be red when the screen size is bigger.
Use Dev Tools to help!
